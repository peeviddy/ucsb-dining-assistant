what if you could just ask your phone/iot thing where to eat and didn't have to compare the menus for 15 minutes (or is that just me???)
- if you're better at dialogflow and google cloud stuff please contact me

oh no my computer exploded:
1. start with clean ubuntu 18.04 bionic
2. install python 3.7, pip, virtualenv
3. create virtualenv of python 3.7 in this folder, then ```source env/bin/activate``` it.
4. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

if you wanna try the working version contact me cause i have to whitelist your email

known bugs:
- if user signs up on a shared device sometimes we end up with two users

feel free to send me suggestions
